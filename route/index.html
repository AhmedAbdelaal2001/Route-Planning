<p>
  In route planning, the objective is to find the best way to get from point A to point B (think Google Maps).
  In this homework, we will build on top of the classic shortest path problem to allow for more powerful queries. For
  example, not only will you be able to explicitly ask for the shortest path from the Gates Building to Coupa Cafe at
  Green Library, but you can ask for the shortest path from Gates back to your dorm, stopping by the package center,
  gym, and the dining hall (in any order!) along the way.
</p>

<p>
  We will assume that we have a <i>map</i> of a city (e.g., Stanford) consisting of a set of <i>locations</i>.
  Each location has:
  <ol>
    <li>a unique label (e.g., 6608996258),</li>
    <li>a (latitude, longitude) pair specifying where the location is (e.g., 37.4299866, -122.175519), and</li>
    <li>a set of <i>tags</i> which describes the type of location (e.g., amenity=food).</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  There are a set of <i>connections</i> between pairs of locations; each connection has a <i>distance</i> (in meters),
  and can be traversed in both directions (if the distance from A to B is 100 meters, then the distance from B to A is
  also 100 meters).
</p>

<p>
  There are two city maps that you'll be working with: a grid map (<code>createGridMap</code>) and a map of
  Stanford (<code>createStanfordMap</code>), which is derived from
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">Open Street Maps</a>.
  We have also included instructions on how to create your own maps in <code>README.md</code>.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 0: Grid City</div>

<p>
  Consider an infinite city consisting of locations $(x,y)$ where $x, y$ are integers.
  From each location $(x,y)$, one can go east, west, north, or south.
  You start at $(0,0)$ and want to go to $(m, n)$, where $m, n \geq 0$.
  We can define the following search problem to capture this:
  <ul>
    <li>$s_\text{start} = (0,0)$</li>
    <li>$\text{Actions}(s) = \{ (+1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, +1), (0, -1) \}$</li>
    <li>$\text{Succ}(s, a) = s + a$</li>
    <li>$\text{Cost}((x,y), a) = 1 + \max(x, 0)$ (it is more expensive as $x$ increases)</li>
    <li>$\text{IsEnd}(s) = \mathbf{1}[s = (m,n)]$</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup" id="0a">
  What is the minimum cost of reaching location $(m,n)$ (note that $m,n \geq 0$) starting from location $(0,0)$ in the above city? Describe one possible path achieving the minimum cost.  Is it unique (i.e., are there multiple paths that achieve the minimum cost)?
  <div class="expected">Provide an expression for the minimum cost. In addition, using 1 - 2 sentences describe one possible minimum cost path and state whether it is unique.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="0b">
  How will Uniform Cost Search (UCS) behave on this problem? Mark the following as true or false:
  <ol>
    <li>UCS will never terminate because the number of states is infinite.</li>
    <li>UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations between $(0,0)$ and $(m,n)$; that is, $(x,y)$ such that $0 \le x \le m$ and $0 \le y \le n$.</li>
    <li>UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations whose past costs are less than the minimum cost from $(0,0)$ to $(m,n)$.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="expected">T/F for each subpart.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="0c">
  Now consider running UCS on an arbitrary graph. Mark the following as true or false:
  <ol>
    <li>If you add a connection between two locations, the minimum distance cannot go up.</li>
    <li>If you make the cost of an action from some state small enough (possibly negative), that action will show up in the minimum cost path.</li>
    <li>If you increase the cost of each action by 1, the minimum cost path does not change (even though its cost does).</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="expected">T/F for each subpart.</div>
</li>

</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Finding Shortest Paths</div>

<p>
  We first start out with the problem of finding the shortest path from a <i>start location</i>
  (e.g., the Gates Building) to some end location. In Google Maps, you can only specify a specific end location
  (e.g., Coupa Cafe at Green Library).
  <br/><br/>
  In this problem, we want to give the user the flexibility of specifying <i>multiple</i> possible end
  locations by specifying a set of "tags" (e.g., so you can say that you want to go to <i>any</i> place with food versus
  a specific location like Tressider).
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="1a">
    Implement <code>ShortestPathProblem</code> so that given a <code>startLocation</code> and <code>endTag</code>,
    the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from <code>startLocation</code> to <i>any</i> location that
    has the <code>endTag</code>.
  <p>
    In particular, you need to implement <code>startState()</code>, <code>isEnd(state)</code>,
    <code>successorsAndCosts(state)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall the separation between search problem (modeling) and search algorithm (inference).
    You should focus on modeling (defining the <code>ShortestPathProblem</code>); the default search algorithm,
    <code>UniformCostSearch</code> (UCS), is implemented for you in <code>util.py</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="expected">An implementation of the <code>ShortestPathProblem</code> class.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="1b">
  Run <code>python mapUtil.py &gt; readableStanfordMap.txt</code> to write a (long-ish) file of the possible locations on
  the Stanford map along with their tags.
  Each tag is a <code>[key]=[value]</code>.  Here are some examples of keys:
  <ul>
    <li><code>landmark</code>: Hand-defined landmarks (from <code>data/stanford-landmarks.json</code>)</li>
    <li><code>amenity</code>: Various amenity types (e.g., "park", "food")</li>
    <li><code>parking</code>: Assorted parking options (e.g., "underground")</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Choose a starting location and end tag (perhaps that's relevant to your daily life) and implement
    <code>getStanfordShortestPathProblem()</code> to create a search problem. Then, run
    <code>python grader.py 1b-custom</code> to generate <code>path.json</code>. Once generated, run
    <code>python visualization.py</code> to visualize it (opens in browser).
    Try different start locations and end tags.
    Pick two settings corresponding to the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A start location and end tag that produced new insight into traveling around campus.
        Describe whether the system was useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        A start location and end tag where the minimum cost path found isn't desirable.
        Is this due to incorrect modeling assumptions?   Explain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    You should feel free to add new landmarks and if you are not at Stanford, follow the instructions in the
    <code>README.md</code> to use your own map and landmarks.
  </p>
  <div class="expected">
    A screenshot of the visualization of your two solutions as well as i) one or more sentences describing something interesting you've learned
    about traveling (around campus, or elsewhere) and ii) something incorrect about either the map or modeling assumptions (such a landmark being out of place, etc.).
  </div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="1c">
  Your system now allows anyone to find the shortest path between any pair of locations on campus. By shortening
  their travel distance, it promises to optimize travel efficiency.

  <p>
    But now, what happens when a large fraction of the population start using your system to plan their routes?
    In particular, what <i>negative externalities</i> might result from this system being widely deployed (see these
    brief articles for inspiration:
    <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-traffic-apps-make-congestion-worse" target="_blank">

      "The Perfect Selfishness of Mapping Apps"
    </a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss the impact of these externalities on users of your system and other people. Remember that problems
    often arise from the mismatch between the real world and one's model of it.
    How would you reduce this mismatch?
  </p>
  <div class="expected">
    Provide 3-5 sentences describing at least two externalities (one for users and one for other people), and
    what you could do to address these problems.

</li>
</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Finding Shortest Paths with Unordered Waypoints</div>

<p>
  Let's introduce an even more powerful feature: unordered waypoints! In Google Maps, you can specify an ordered
  sequence of waypoints that a path must go through – for example, going from point A to point X to point Y to point B,
  where [X, Y] are "waypoints" (such as a gas station or a friend's house).
</p>
<p>
  However, we want to consider the case where the waypoints are <i>unordered</i>: {X, Y}, so that both A &rarr; X &rarr; Y &rarr; B
  and A &rarr; Y &rarr; X &rarr; B are allowed. Moreover, X, Y, and B are each specified by a tag like in Problem 1 (e.g.,
  <code>amenity=food</code>).
</p>
<p>
  This is a neat feature if you think about your day-to-day life; you might be on your way home after a long day, but
  need to stop by the package center, Tressider to grab a bite of food, and the bookstore to buy some notebooks. Having
  the ability to get a short, quick path that hits all these stops might be really convenient (rather than searching
  over the various waypoint orderings yourself).
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="2a">
  Implement <code>WaypointsShortestPathProblem</code> so that given a <code>startLocation</code>, set of
  <code>waypointTags</code>, and an <code>endTag</code>, the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from
  <code>startLocation</code> to a location with the <code>endTag</code>, such that all of <code>waypointTags</code> are
  covered by some location in the path.
  <br/>
  Note that a single location can be used to satisfy multiple tags.
  <p>
    Like in Problem 1, you need to implement <code>startState()</code>, <code>isEnd(state)</code>, and
    <code>successorsAndCosts(state)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many ways to implement this search problem, so you should think carefully about how to design your
    <code>State</code>. We want to optimize for a compact state space so that search is as efficient as possible.
  </p>

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>WaypointsShortestPathProblem</code> class. To get full credit, your implementation

</li>

<li class="writeup" id="2c">
  Choose a starting location, set of waypoint tags, and an end tag (perhaps that captures an interesting route planning
  problem relevant to you), and implement <code>getStanfordWaypointsShortestPathProblem()</code> to create a
  search problem. Then, similar to Problem 1b, run <code>python grader.py 2c-custom</code> to generate <code>path.json</code>.
  Once generated, run <code>python visualization.py</code> to visualize it (opens in browser).
  <div class="expected">
    A screenshot of the visualized path with a list of the waypoint tags you selected. In addition, provide

  Ride sharing companies use route finding systems similar to the one you built in this problem to route drivers. Such
  companies have been criticized for using behavioral nudges in their driver-facing applications; for example, a
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html" target="_blank">
    New York Times article
  </a>
  reported how the app uses features such as “forward dispatch” (a feature that dispatches a new ride to a driver
  before the current one ends) to constantly keep drivers busy. This makes it more difficult for drivers to take breaks.
  <p>
    How would you implement better labor practices for drivers, balancing company goals with the protection of driver
    interests? How could your new unordered waypoints feature help? What waypoints would you include from one
    drop-off location to the next pick-up location for drivers, and what information about drivers would you need to
    determine appropriate waypoints?
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the unordered waypoints feature is an example of a <i>dual use</i> technology: what are some waypoints
    that a company might use to increase its profits at the expense of driver health?

  <div class="expected">
    Provide 3-5 sentences describing waypoints to include, at least one dimension of drivers' identity that could inform

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Speeding up Search with A*</div>

<p>
  In this problem, we will explore how to speed up search by reducing the number of
  states that need to be expanded using various A* heuristics.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="3a">
    In this problem, you will implement A* to speed up the search. Recall that in class,
    A* is just UCS with a different cost function (a new search problem), so we will
    implement A* via a <i>reduction</i> to UCS.
  <p>
    In particular, you should implement <code>aStarReduction()</code>
    which takes a search <code>problem</code> and a <code>heuristic</code> as input
    and returns a new search problem.
  </p>

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>NewSearchProblem</code> class in the
    <code>aStarReduction(problem, heuristic)</code> function. As in prior problems, you need to implement

  </div>
</li>

<li class="code" id="3b">
  We are now ready to speed up search by simply implementing various heuristics.
  First, implement <code>StraightLineHeuristic</code> for Problem 1, which returns the
  straight line distance from a state to any location with the end tag.
  Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast.

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>StraightLineHeuristic</code> class.
  </div>
</li>

<li class="code" id="3c">
  Next, implement <code>NoWaypointsHeuristic</code> for Problem 2, which returns the minimum cost path from a state to
  any location with the end tag but ignoring all the waypoints (essentially the solution to Problem 1, so you can
  reuse that if you'd like). Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast. 
  Helpful comments are provided in the code.

  <div class="expected">

  <p>
    Provide a concrete example of $n$ <code>waypointTags</code> so that running A* with
